        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Alright, so here’s the deal—I’m Mohammed Izhan. I’m out here trying to make sense of business chaos as an aspiring Business Analyst. Basically, I geek out over turning messy, complicated problems into stuff that actually makes sense (and works). I’m all about digging into data, drawing up processes, and chatting with folks to figure out what’s really needed. I mess around with SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Python—yeah, a bit of a tech nerd—just to squeeze the right insights out of all that number soup. I’ve spent time connecting the dots between what people want and what tech can do. Got some chops in Agile, SDLC, and writing up docs that don’t put everyone to sleep. Toss me in a team where business and tech collide, and I’m in my element. Hungry to jump into projects that matter, bridge the business–tech gap, and, honestly, learn as much as possible while I’m at it.</p>

                <h3>Employee Attrition Analysis</h3>
                <p>Whipped up this interactive Tableau dashboard to break down employee attrition, department by department and all that jazz. Dug into a bunch of HR stats—think: who’s leaving, what age, what role, and so on—just to see what’s really going on with retention. You could mess with filters, compare attrition rates, and peek at some KPIs, making it actually useful for HR folks (and not just another boring chart). It’s a mix of storytelling and straight-up number crunching—helped pull out some real insights from a sea of workforce data.</p>

                <h3>Global Education Trends</h3>
                <p>Built a dashboard in Tableau to make sense of global education stats, because who doesn’t love a good map or a bubble chart? Looked at stuff like gender gaps in primary education, youth literacy across countries, school dropouts, and even how school enrollment ties into unemployment. Played around with visualizations—maps, bubbles, scatter plots—to show how things stack up between countries and over the years. Made the data actually talk, not just sit there looking pretty.</p>
